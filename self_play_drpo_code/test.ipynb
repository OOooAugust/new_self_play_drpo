It could be a design or implementation issue with the client or a configuration issue with the Postfix server. It is also possible that there is a network or server issue causing the duplication. It would be best to investigate the client and server configurations and network settings to determine the root cause.', 'a2': 'When using JavaMail Sender API with a Postfix email server, duplicate \"To:\" headers in the email can occur due to multiple reasons. Here are a few potential causes:\\n\\n1. **Multithreaded execution**: If your application sends multiple emails concurrently, it\\'s possible that the emails are being sent so fast that the recipient information in the \"To:\" header is not cleared properly between each email. \\n\\n2. **Incorrect usage of JavaMail Sender API**: There might be a mistake in the way you\\'re using JavaMail Sender API, causing the \"To:\" header to be added more than once. For example, if there\\'s a loop in your code that adds the recipients to the \"To:\" header multiple times, this could cause duplicates.\\n\\n3. **Relay hosting**: Some email services use a relay server to send emails. If the relay server is not correctly handling the requests, it might be causing the duplicates in the \"To:\" header.\\n\\n4. **Postfix Server Issue**: In some cases, the Postfix server itself might be the cause. If the server is not correctly handling the incoming emails, it might be adding duplicates to the \"To:\" header.\\n\\nTo solve the issue, you can try the following:\\n\\n- Make sure you\\'re not adding recipients to the \"To:\" header multiple times by mistake.\\n- Use a thread-safe method to send different emails.\\n- Check your email service and relay server settings to ensure they\\'re correctly set.\\n- Test your email sending process in different scenarios to see if the issue is reproducible.\\n- If all else fails, you might need to check the Postfix server settings and logs. You can check the logs for `mail.warn`, `mail.err` or `mail.info` to get more insight into what\\'s happening on the mail server.\\n\\nRemember, it\\'s always a good practice to validate and debug your code and processes to avoid such issues.', 'rank': 0}\n",

      "First, Zero Hunger is a term that refers to people who are not overweight or obese, and who are trying to get rid of their \"pants on the floor\" mentality. Many people are in the process of losing weight, and they feel that this is a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Zero Hunger can be a very positive thing for the person who is trying to lose weight. Many people who are trying to lose weight are getting discouraged, and some feel like they are going to fail. But, if they are trying to lose weight and are having success, they feel much better about themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, Zero Hunger is not necessarily a diet. It's not a diet for those who have never been overweight, or for those who are obese. It's a diet for those who want to lose weight, but aren't trying to lose it.\n",

      "Finally\n",
      "\u001b[43mprompt_a2:\u001b[0m Also inluce what is Zero HungerZero Hunger is the second of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations and adopted by all 193 member states in 2015. The aim of this goal is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving Zero Hunger involves several key targets:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ending hunger: This involves providing access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for all people, particularly those living in vulnerable situations such as poverty, conflict, and natural disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Ending all forms of malnutrition: Malnutrition includes undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies. The goal is to ensure that children, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons have adequate access to nutritious foods to meet their nutritional needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Doubling agricultural productivity and incomes: Efforts to increase the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers, particularly in developing regions, can help alleviate poverty and secure food access for those living in rural areas. This includes promoting sustainable farming practices, providing access to resources, and implementing modern technologies to boost productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Ensuring sustainable food production systems: Promoting resilient and sustainable agriculture practices can help maintain ecosystems, strengthen the capacity to adapt to climate change, and preserve the natural resource base for future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Maintaining genetic diversity in agriculture: Protecting and preserving the genetic diversity of seeds, plants, and animals is crucial for food security and sustainable agriculture. This includes promoting fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from the use of genetic resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Increasing investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure: Investments in agriculture, including research and development, can help build a foundation for sustainable and resilient food systems. Infrastructure development, such as better roads and irrigation systems, can also improve access to markets and resources for farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Ensuring equitable access to land, technology, and other resources: Access to land, technology, and other resources is vital for sustainable agricultural growth. Ensuring that resources are distributed fairly, especially to women, indigenous peoples, and other marginalized groups, can help close gaps in food security and income inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to achieve Zero Hunger involve coordination and cooperation at international, national, and community levels. Governments, private organizations, civil society, and individual citizens all have a role to play in working towards a world free from hunger and malnutrition.\n"
